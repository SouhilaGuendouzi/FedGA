# FedGA-ICPS
FedGA-ICPS is a federated learning (FL) framework based on genetic algorithms for dynamic aggregation in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) to adapt federated learning with non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data as well as neural networks (NN) modelsâ€™ heterogeneity. Further, the goal is to achieve a robust learning, higher accuracy, aggregation stability, and rapid convergence for ICPS. FedGA-ICPS is developed based on PyTorch, and PyGAD library.
